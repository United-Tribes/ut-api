## üîë Understanding Responses

### Enhanced Attribution
Every response includes detailed source information:

```json
{
  "sources": [
    {
      "source": "Rolling Stone",
      "evidence_text": "Dylan's impact on folk music cannot be overstated",
      "citation": "\"Dylan's impact on folk music cannot be overstated\" from Dylan's Legacy by Music Historian, Rolling Stone",
      "confidence": 0.92,
      "paragraph_number": 2,
      "url": "https://rollingstone.com/dylan-legacy"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Quality Metrics
Understand the reliability of your results:

```json
{
  "attribution_quality": 0.95,      // How complete is the source attribution
  "citation_readiness": 1.0,        // Percentage of citation-ready sources  
  "source_verification_score": 0.85 // How many sources are verifiable
}
```

### Discovery Pathways
Get suggestions for deeper exploration:

```json
{
  "discovery_pathways": [
    "Explore verified connections between Bob Dylan and Joan Baez",
    "Find well-documented influences on Bob Dylan",
    "Discover more insights from Rolling Stone"
  ]
}
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Services won't start:**
```bash
# Check if ports are already in use
lsof -i :8001
lsof -i :8002

# Use different ports if needed
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up
```

**Empty responses:**
```bash
# Check if vector store has data
curl http://localhost:8002/data/summary

# Trigger index build if needed
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8002/index/build" \
  -d '{"index_name": "enhanced_main", "force_rebuild": true}'
```

**Authentication errors (production):**
```bash
# Verify your API key
export UT_API_KEY="your-api-key"
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $UT_API_KEY" https://api.unitedtribes.com/health
```
